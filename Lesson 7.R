# The Automobile Association gave the average price of unleaded petrol in
# Sweden as 14.63 Swedish Krona (SK) per litre in June 2012. Assume this
# price is the population mean, and that the population standard deviation is
# q = 1 SK.

# a)
# What is the probability that the mean price for a sample of 30 petrol
# stations is within 0,25 SK of the population mean?

p <- diff(pnorm(c(-0.25,0.25)*sqrt(30)))
# b)
# What is the probability that the mean price for a sample of 50 petrol
# stations is within 0,25 SK of the population mean?
p2 <- diff(pnorm(c(-0.25,0.25)*sqrt(50)))

# c)
# What is the probability that the mean price for a sample 100 petrol
# stations is within 0,25 SK of the population mean?
p3 <- diff(pnorm(c(-0.25,0.25)*sqrt(100)))

# d)
# Would you recommend a sample size of 30, 50 or 100 to have at
# least a 0,95 probability that the sample mean is within 0,25 SK of the
# population mean?

# Recommend n = 100, because
# the probabilities in (a) and (b) are below 0.95, in (c) above 0.95.

# According to Golf Digest, the average score for male golfers is 95 and the
# average score for female golfers is 106. Use these values as population
# means. Assume that the population standard deviation is q = 14 strokes
# for both men and women. A simple random sample of 30 male golfers and
# another simple random sample of 45 female golfers are taken.


# a) Sketch the sampling distribution of X for male golfers.

sd = 14
nMale = 30
nFemale = 45
devitation = sd/sqrt(nMale) #richtig

averageOfAll = (95*nMale + 106*nFemale)/(nMale+nFemale)



p = diff(rnorm(nMale, mean = averageOfAll, sd = devitation))
sd(p)
#?????????????????

#b) What is the probability that the sample mean is within 3 strokes of the
# population mean for the sample of male golfers?

pnorm(98,mean=95,sd=(14/sqrt(30))) - pnorm(92,mean=95,sd=(14/sqrt(30)))

# c) What is the probability that the sample mean is within 3 strokes of the 
# population mean for the sample of female golfers?
pnorm(109,mean=106,sd=(14/sqrt(45))) - pnorm(103,mean=106,sd=(14/sqrt(45)))

#d) In which case is the probability higher (b or c)? Why?
#In c, because of the larger sample size --> smaller standard error

# Advertisers contract with Internet service providers and search engines to
# place ads on websites. They pay a fee based on the number of potential
# customers who click on their ads. Unfortunately, click fraud - i.e. someone
# clicking on an ad solely for the purpose of driving up advertising revenue -
#   has become a problem. Forty per cent of advertisers claim they have been a
# victim of click fraud. Suppose a simple random sample of 380 advertisers is
# taken to learn about how they are affected by this practice.

# a) What is the probability the sample proportion will be within +-0.04 of
# the population proportion experiencing click fraud?
